# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains two machine learning projects as part of a university Machine Learning course focused on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation on real-world tabular datasets.


## 1. Titanic Survival Prediction (Binary Classification)

### Goal
Predict passenger survival using structured data with mixed feature types.

### Main Steps
- Data loading and train/validation/test split
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Categorical encoding and numerical transformations
- Feature engineering
- Model training and comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation using F1-score and ROC-AUC
- Final model selection and prediction on unseen data

### Models Used
- Decision Tree
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)


## 2. Life Expectancy Prediction (Regression)

### Goal
Predict life expectancy based on socioeconomic and health indicators.

### Main Steps
- Data preprocessing and missing value handling
- Feature transformation and scaling
- Custom implementation of Random Forest
- Training and comparison of multiple regression models
- Hyperparameter tuning (based on RMSE)
- Evaluation using RMSE and MAE
- Final model selection and prediction on unseen data

### Models Used
- Custom Random Forest (implemented from scratch)
- Linear / Ridge Regression
- AdaBoost
